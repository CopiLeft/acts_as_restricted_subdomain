module RestrictedSubdomain
  module Model
    ##
    # This method will mark a class as the subdomain model. It expects to
    # contain the subdomain in a column. You can override the default (:code)
    # by passing a :by parameter. That column will be validated for presence
    # and uniqueness, so be sure to add an index on that column.
    #
    # This will add a cattr_accessor of current which will always contain
    # the current subdomain requested from the controller.
    #
    # A method for iterating over each subdomain model is also provided,
    # called each_subdomain. Pass a block and do whatever you need to do
    # restricted to a particular scope of that subdomain. Useful for console
    # and automated tasks where each subdomain has particular features that
    # may differ from each other.
    #
    # Example:
    #   class Agency < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     use_for_restricted_subdomains :by => :code
    #   end
    #
    def use_for_restricted_subdomains(opts = {})
      options = {
        :by => :code
      }.merge(opts)

      validates_uniqueness_of options[:by]

    # This method marks a model as restricted to a subdomain. This means that
    # it will have an association to whatever class models your subdomain,
    # see use_for_restricted_subdomains. It overrides the default find method
    # to always include a subdomain column parameter. You need to pass the
    # subdomain class symbol and column (defaults klass to :agency).
    #
    # Adds validation for the column and a belongs_to association.
    #
    # This does not add any has_many associations in your subdomain class.
    # That is an exercise left to the user, sorry. Also beware of
    # validates_uniqueness_of. It should be scoped to the foreign key.
    #
    # Example:
    #   
    #   class Widget < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     acts_as_restricted_subdomain :through => :subdomain
    #   end
    #   
    #   class Subdomain < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     use_for_restricted_subdomains :by => :name
    #   end
    #
    # Special thanks to the Caboosers who created acts_as_paranoid. This is
    # pretty much the same thing, only without the delete_all bits.
